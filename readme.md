# YOLOv8 Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the YOLOv8 project, including cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and running the Jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Replace yourusername and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
3. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Run the following command:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv yolov8_env
4. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:

On Windows:

sh
Copy code
yolov8_env\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

sh
Copy code
source yolov8_env/bin/activate
5. Install Requirements
Install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Start the Jupyter notebook server:

sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This command will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter notebook interface. Navigate to the desired notebook file (e.g., your_notebook.ipynb) and start running the cells.

Additional Information
Make sure to always activate your virtual environment before running any Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

sh
Copy code
deactivate
